# MazeDrawer
An algorithm to draw mazes, and then solve them

An output maze:

And an example path is: 
![HERE!](https://github.com/armantorik/MazeDrawer/blob/master/MazeAlgo/MazeAlgo/maze_3_path_3_0_0_4.txt?raw=true)

Path generation is done using Stack, it goes to a random direction until it becomes stalled, if stalled, then backtracks using the Stack.

The point of the project was to understand the usage of the Stack data structure.
